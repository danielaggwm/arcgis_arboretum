It is briefly deciduous in early spring, but the leaves are quickly replaced with new growth. Although some believe that trees produced from seed are preferable, branches planted in the ground will root easily. Gumbo LImbo has been used for living fence posts and wind protection, and its soft, lightweight wood is easily carved peeling.
