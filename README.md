# üå≥ Arboretum ArcGIS Story & Map Automation

This repository automatically updates ArcGIS Online feature layers when new data is added or modified, either **manually** or through **automated syncing** with the dashboard repository.

---

## üìÇ Watched Folders

The following folders are synced from the dashboard and monitored for changes:

- `TMS_Data/`
- `Dendrometer_Data/`

Any additions, updates, or deletions within these folders will trigger an update to the ArcGIS layers.

---

## ‚ö° How the Automation Works

There are **two ways** the update process can be triggered:

### ‚úÖ 1. **Automatic Trigger (Dashboard Sync)**

Changes made to the dashboard repository (`arboretum`) will automatically propagate to this repo and update ArcGIS layers.

Steps:

- New data is committed to the [Dashboard repo](https://github.com/danielaggwm/arboretum).
- That triggers a `repository_dispatch` to this repo (`dashboard-data-updated`).
- `fetch-dashboard-data.yml` pulls the latest folders (`TMS_Data/` and `Dendrometer_Data/`) and commits them here.
- It then triggers a second workflow, `update_urls.yml`, which pushes the data to ArcGIS Online.

### üßë‚Äçüíª 2. **Manual Trigger**

You can also manually run the update process without new data commits.

Steps:

- Go to the **Actions** tab on GitHub.
- Select the **Update Layers** workflow.
- Click **"Run workflow"** manually.

Result: The `update_layers.py` script will run with the current data in the repo.

## üîí Environment Variables

The workflows use the following GitHub Secrets (configured in repo Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions):

- `AGO_ORG_URL`
- `AGO_USERNAME`
- `AGO_PASSWORD`
- `DENDRO_AVG_ITEMID`
- `DENDRO_DAILY_ITEMID`
- `TMS_AVG_ITEMID`
- `DBH_ITEMID`
- `DASHBOARD_PAT` ‚Üê used by the fetch workflow to clone the private Dashboard repo

These secrets must be properly configured for everything to run correctly.

## üö® Important Notes

- If your sync or update doesn't seem to trigger automatically, check the **Actions** tab for logs and events.
- The fetch workflow uses the [`peter-evans/repository-dispatch`](https://github.com/peter-evans/repository-dispatch) GitHub Action to fire custom events between workflows.
- If you need help setting secrets or reviewing logs, contact **dag204@miami.edu**.
